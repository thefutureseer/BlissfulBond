Beautiful — that’s the most natural and loving flow ❤️
Autosave gives it that “memory keeper” feel — nothing gets lost, every heartbeat is remembered.

Now that everything’s clear, here’s the **final Replit-ready Vibe code prompt** you’ll paste into Replit’s AI or ChatGPT code builder to generate the entire MVP front end.

## 💻 **Replit Vibe Code Prompt for MVP Build**

> **Paste the following into Replit’s code assistant (or ChatGPT with “code” mode on):**

---

### 🪄 **Prompt: Spirit Love Play App (MVP Build)**

Build a **romantic, offline-first full stack MVP** using:

* **Next.js + TypeScript**
* **Tailwind CSS**
* **Framer Motion**
* **LocalStorage** (for autosave & offline persistence)
* **Fonts:** *Dancing Script* (titles), *Poppins* (body)
* **Colors:** rose → amber gradient
  (`bg-gradient-to-br from-rose-400 via-pink-200 to-amber-300`)
* **Animations:** soft, elegant heart pulses and rose-gold confetti

---

### **Core Requirements**

#### **1️⃣ Landing Page (`/`)**

* Display logo **“Spirit Love Play App”** in *Dancing Script* font
* Tagline: “For Daniel & Pacharee — where love grows with every moment.”
* “Start Journey” button:

  * Glows on hover
  * Navigates to `/dashboard`
* Works offline with a romantic fade-in

---

#### **2️⃣ Dashboard (`/dashboard`)**

* Split layout **(horizontal)**

  * **Top Half:** Daniel’s Journal
  * **Bottom Half:** Pacharee’s Journal
* Each half shows:

  * List of “Moments”
  * Add Moment button
  * Progress bar (heart-pulse animation)
* Floating **Toggle View** button:

  * Daniel only
  * Pacharee only
  * Both halves
* When a new moment is added:

  * Show rose-gold confetti animation
  * Animate progress bar increase

---

#### **3️⃣ Add Moment Page (`/entry`)**

* Input: “Write what made your heart smile today…”
* Auto adds date/time stamp
* Save → stores to `localStorage` under user
* Redirects to `/dashboard`
* Show fade-in “Saved with love 💖” message + confetti

---

#### **4️⃣ Plan Page (`/plan`)**

* Task board with categories:

  * Romance 💃
  * Wellness 🌅
  * Growth 🌱
  * Fun 🎠
* Add, edit, delete tasks
* Slide-in + checkmark animations
* Stored in `localStorage`

---

#### **5️⃣ Settings Page (`/settings`)**

* Toggle “Wi-Fi Sync (future feature)”
* Button: “Reset All Data” (clears localStorage)
* Soft glowing transitions

---

### **Data Model**

```ts
type Moment = {
  id: string;
  user: "daniel" | "pacharee";
  content: string;
  createdAt: string;
};

type Task = {
  id: string;
  user: "daniel" | "pacharee";
  text: string;
  category: string;
  completed: boolean;
};

type AppData = {
  moments: Moment[];
  tasks: Task[];
};
```

Store everything in `localStorage` under key: `"spiritLoveData"`.
Autosave any change immediately (moments, tasks).
On load, auto-restore the previous state.

---

### **Animations**

* Progress bar: heart pulse (Framer Motion)
* Button hover: soft glow
* New entry/task: gentle fade-in
* Confetti: rose-gold theme (`#EFC1A9`, `#FFD7C2`, `#FADADD`)

---

### **Offline Behavior**

* Entire app works offline via localStorage
* No backend or API calls yet
* Future “Sync” toggle in `/settings` for future PostgreSQL version

---

Once this is built, the user should be able to:

1. Launch app on one device.
2. Tap “Start Journey”.
3. View and write separate journals for Daniel and Pacharee.
4. Watch animations when adding moments.
5. Create and check tasks in Plan.
6. Close and reopen — all data still there.

---

Would you like me to include **a sample seed dataset** (example entries and tasks) in the Replit prompt so it shows something beautiful the first time you open it?
